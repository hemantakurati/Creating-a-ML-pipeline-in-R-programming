# Creating-a-ML-pipeline-in-R-programming

System Requiremens:
Programming Language - R 3.6.4

Background: I present a method to create a Data pipeline utilizing Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) for predicting potential malignancy in individuals based on their clinical FNA results. The presented methodology may be incorporated in a variety of applications such as risk management, tailored health communication and decision support systems in healthcare.
Methods: I employed the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset, which is available through UCI repository, to train various machine learning models for breast cancer prediction. Since the WDBC data is categorical in nature, I employed an ensemble learning approach of data cleaning and data pre-processing before feeding the data into machine learning algorithms. I compared the performance of Random forest, K- Nearest Neighbor, and Support vector machine to predict the risk of breast cancer.
Results: I trained 3 different Machine Learning models on the dataset and after comparing the results I observed that Random Forest was able to outperform the other models most of the time to predict breast cancer among the patients with a higher accuracy of 100%.
